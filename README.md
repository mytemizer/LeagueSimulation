# League Simulator

A modern Android application for simulating football tournaments with realistic team generation, match simulation, and live standings tracking. Built with Jetpack Compose and Clean Architecture principles.

## üèÜ Features

### Core Functionality
- **Random Team Generation**: Create realistic football teams with varying skill levels (World Class, Excellent, Good, Mixed)
- **Match Simulation**: Advanced simulation engine with realistic scoring based on team attributes
- **Live Tournament Progress**: Track matches, standings, and tournament progression in real-time
- **Interactive Navigation**: Seamless navigation between Welcome, Team Creation, Match, and Standings screens

### Team Generation
- **Realistic Team Attributes**: Teams have individual ratings for Attack, Midfield, Defense, and Goalkeeper
- **Quality Tiers**: Choose from different team quality levels to create balanced or varied tournaments
- **Authentic Details**: Teams include realistic names, cities, stadiums, colors, and founding years
- **Dynamic Ratings**: Overall team rating calculated from weighted individual attributes

### Match Simulation
- **Advanced Algorithm**: Considers team strengths, home advantage, and randomness factors
- **Realistic Scoring**: Goal simulation based on attacking strength vs defensive capabilities
- **Round-Robin Format**: Complete group stage with 6 matches across 3 rounds
- **Match Results**: Detailed score tracking with winner determination

### Tournament Management
- **Group Standings**: Rules compliant ranking system (Points ‚Üí Goal Difference ‚Üí Goals For ‚Üí Goals Against ‚Üí Head-to-Head)
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual indicators for current round, matches played, and tournament completion
- **State Management**: Persistent tournament state throughout the application lifecycle

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application follows **Clean Architecture** principles with a modular design:

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/                          # Presentation layer (UI, ViewModels, Navigation)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ common/                   # Shared utilities and extensions
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ design/                   # UI components and theme
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ domain/                   # Business logic, use cases, models
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/                     # Repository implementations
```

### Architecture Principles
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between layers
- **Dependency Inversion**: Dependencies point inward toward the domain layer
- **Single Responsibility**: Each module has a focused purpose
- **Testability**: Isolated components for easy unit testing

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Kotlin**: Primary programming language
- **Jetpack Compose**: Modern declarative UI toolkit
- **Compose Navigation**: Type-safe navigation between screens
- **Material 3**: Google's latest design system

### Architecture Components
- **ViewModel**: UI-related data management with lifecycle awareness
- **StateFlow**: Reactive state management
- **Coroutines**: Asynchronous programming and concurrency

### Dependency Injection
- **Koin**: Lightweight dependency injection framework

### Development Tools
- **Gradle Version Catalogs**: Centralized dependency management
- **Kotlin DSL**: Type-safe build scripts

## üìã Rules

### Tournament Format
The application simulates a **group stage tournament** with 4 teams playing in a round-robin format where each team plays every other team once.

### Match Structure
- **Total Matches**: 6 matches across 3 rounds
- **Round 1**: Team 1 vs Team 2, Team 3 vs Team 4
- **Round 2**: Team 1 vs Team 3, Team 2 vs Team 4
- **Round 3**: Team 1 vs Team 4, Team 2 vs Team 3

### Scoring System
- **Win**: 3 points
- **Draw**: 1 point
- **Loss**: 0 points

### Group Standings
Teams are ranked according to the following criteria in order of priority:

1. **Points** (highest first)
2. **Goal Difference** (highest first)
3. **Goals For** (highest first)
4. **Goals Against** (lowest first)
5. **Head-to-Head Result** (direct match result between tied teams)

### Knockout Stage Advancement
At the end of the group stage, the tournament results show:
- **Final group positions** (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th)
- **Complete match results** between all teams
- **Teams advancing to knockout stage**: Top 2 teams (1st and 2nd place) qualify for the next round

The graphical end result displays the final group table with all mutual results, clearly indicating which teams advance based on the sorting criteria.
