‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/                          # Presentation layer (UI, ViewModels, Navigation)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ gradle/                       # Gradle wrapper and configuration
```

### Architecture Principles
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between layers
- **Dependency Inversion**: Dependencies point inward toward the domain layer
- **Single Responsibility**: Each module has a focused purpose
- **Testability**: Isolated components for easy unit testing

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Kotlin**: Primary programming language
- **Jetpack Compose**: Modern declarative UI toolkit
- **Compose Navigation**: Type-safe navigation between screens
- **Material 3**: Google's latest design system

### Architecture Components
- **ViewModel**: UI-related data management with lifecycle awareness
- **StateFlow**: Reactive state management
- **Coroutines**: Asynchronous programming and concurrency

### Dependency Injection
- **Koin**: Lightweight dependency injection framework

### Development Tools

## üìã Rules

### Tournament Format
The application simulates a **group stage tournament** with 4/6/8/10/12 teams playing in a round-robin format where each team plays every other team once.

### Match Structure
- **Total Matches**: 6 matches across 3 rounds for 4 teams
- **Round 1**: Team 1 vs Team 2, Team 3 vs Team 4
- **Round 2**: Team 1 vs Team 3, Team 2 vs Team 4
- **Round 3**: Team 1 vs Team 4, Team 2 vs Team 3

### Scoring System
- **Win**: 3 points
- **Draw**: 1 point
- **Loss**: 0 points

### Group Standings
Teams are ranked according to the following criteria in order of priority:

1. **Points** (highest first)
2. **Goal Difference** (highest first)
3. **Goals For** (highest first)
4. **Goals Against** (lowest first)
5. **Head-to-Head Result** (direct match result between tied teams)

### Knockout Stage Advancement
At the end of the group stage, the tournament results show:
- **Final group positions** (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th)
- **Complete match results** between all teams
- **Teams advancing to knockout stage**: Top 2 teams (1st and 2nd place) qualify for the next round

The graphical end result displays the final group table with all mutual results, clearly indicating which teams advance based on the sorting criteria.
